# AI Health Checker — Lightweight (Image + Symptoms)

**Track:** Health & Public Safety

**Description:**  
Lightweight, hackathon-ready Streamlit app that accepts **an image** and **text symptoms**, applies fast local heuristics (no heavy ML models) to classify into simple categories (Normal, Rash, Wound, Swelling, Infection), and returns confidence + guidance.

**How to run locally**
1. Clone repo
2. Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`

**Notes:** This app uses heuristic rules for quick prototyping and is NOT a medical diagnosis tool.
